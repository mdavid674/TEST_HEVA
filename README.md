## About my render
If you don't want to execute anything, you can just read the result.pdf file in the main folder.

If you want to check my code, you can execute the notebook resulti.ipynb file in the main folder. But, read the requirement.md file before.

You can also read the result.py file. But, it's just a clone of the notebook code. I have create this Python file for a good git versionning.
